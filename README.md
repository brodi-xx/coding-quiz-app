# Brodi's Developer Quiz
In this challenge, I created a portfolio that represented my work and skills developed of HTML, CSS, and Javascript thus far. There has been noticable improvement in my HTML and CSS abilities while being able to utilize my learnings from Javascript to create a functional quiz with a timer, questions with right and wrong responses, and when the game is over you have the ability to save your name and score.

I utlized my Teacher's Assistances, a tutor, and a youtube tutorial to help me complete my work.
